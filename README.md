# Bangalore Home Price Prediction

## Introduction

This project is aimed at predicting home prices in Bangalore based on various factors such as location and size of the house. We have employed machine learning techniques using Python's Scikit-Learn library to build predictive models. After thorough testing, we found that the Linear Regression algorithm provided the best results for our dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about various homes in Bangalore. It includes features such as:

- **Location**: The locality where the house is situated.
- **Size**: The size of the house in terms of the number of bedrooms.
- **Total Square Feet**: The total area of the house in square feet.
- **Bathrooms**: The number of bathrooms in the house.
- **Price**: The target variable, which is the price of the house in lakhs.

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is a crucial step in preparing the dataset for modeling. In this project, we performed the following data cleaning tasks:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: We checked for missing values in the dataset and either removed rows with missing values or imputed them using appropriate methods.

2. **Outlier Detection and Removal**: We identified and handled outliers in the dataset, especially in the 'Price' and 'Total Square Feet' columns, as outliers can significantly impact the accuracy of the models.

3. **Encoding Categorical Variables**: We encoded categorical variables like 'Location' using techniques like one-hot encoding to convert them into a numerical format that can be used by machine learning algorithms.

4. **Feature Scaling**: We standardized or normalized numerical features to ensure that they have the same scale, which is important for many machine learning algorithms.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to acknowledge Dhaval Patel for teaching and guiding us through this project. His expertise and insights were invaluable in developing and fine-tuning our predictive models.

## Usage

To use this project for predicting home prices in Bangalore, you can follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries mentioned in the project.

2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script provided in the project to load the dataset, preprocess the data, and train the Linear Regression model.

4. Once the model is trained, you can input new data (location, size, etc.) to get predictions for home prices.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning techniques, specifically Linear Regression, can be used to predict home prices in Bangalore based on relevant features. Data cleaning and preprocessing play a crucial role in achieving accurate predictions, and the guidance provided by Dhaval Patel greatly contributed to the success of this project.
